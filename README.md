Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm I am writing to express my strong interest in the Devops Engineer  position at Company. With hands-on experience in automating cloud infrastructure using Terraform, building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, and enhancing system performance on AWS, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your engineering objectives.

At CGI, I managed scalable AWS environments using services like EC2, EKS, ELB, AutoScaling and Cloud Formation. I implemented CI/CD workflows with Jenkins and GitHub, Github actions containerized apps using Docker, and orchestrated deployments with Kubernetes (EKS). These efforts reduced deployment time by 20% and improved system reliability.

I’m passionate about automation, cloud security, and performance monitoring using tools like Terraform, Prometheus, and Cloudwatch. I’m excited about the opportunity to bring my Devops expertise to a forward-thinking team like yours.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’d welcome the chance to discuss how I can support your Devops initiatives.


Regards
Saikrishna Katthera
